This is  a program to keep track of time for multiple jobs through multiple days.  
Worked in Javascript with bootstrap in HTML.
When I have time, I'd like to go back and clean up the Javascript by using Angular and creating services with the modular functions.  Currently, there is a lot of repetitive work in the javascript files.  
I would also like to use a database instead of Firebase API.

My intention is for it to be able to make daily, weekly, and monthly comparisons between jobs.
